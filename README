TODO:

- If VCF pitch tracking is turned on let the range of the cutoff knob start lower, so that the filter can always fully close.

- Allow ADSR2 to be independently controlled.
    Best case scenario if possible: ADSR knobs default to controlling ADSR1, but when "hold" is held, they control ADSR2
    "VCA env" knob then becomes a depth of how much ADSR2 modulates the VCA. Turning all the way to the left means
    ADSR2 does not module the VCA at all, allowing the VCA to be modulated by an external source via the patch bay,
    without ADSR2 getting added in. As a bonus, 7 o clock to 3 o clock would increase adsr2's modulation of the VCA,
    but then turning all the way to 5 o clock would lock the VCA open, so that it could be open all the time for droning
    etc.
    
    Also overall output could be higher. If I patch into VCA input I can make a much louder note than the normalled
    ADSR2=>VCA connection can provide. I think the normalled connection should be able to reach the peak volume.
    This would be especially useful if the depth of that normalled connection was controllable in the manner described
    above. If possible you could even drive the VCA harder into some overdrive, if the hardware allows it.
